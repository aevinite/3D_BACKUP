-- 213: heal owner-analytics function drift (found live 2026-07-27)
--
-- The AV-live database diverged from this ledger in exactly three functions:
--   · a STALE 3-arg lfh_owner_payment_breakdown(uuid,tstz,tstz) survived next to the
--     current 4-arg one → PostgREST PGRST203 "could not choose best candidate" on every
--     named-args call → the WHOLE owner group compute threw → the dashboard's
--     "Couldn't load." + endless Loading… the owner saw on aevinite.shop.
--   · the grouped 5-arg lfh_owner_sales_report(…, p_ids) from mig 203 was missing →
--     scoped-owner money reports fell back to N per-restaurant calls.
--   · (the old 4-arg lfh_owner_sales_report then also had to go, or IT would become
--     the next ambiguity once the 5-arg exists.)
--
-- On the dev DB every statement here is a no-op re-assertion; on AV live it heals the
-- drift. The 5-arg body below is copied VERBATIM from mig 203 (still the newest
-- definition — mig 211 deliberately left sales_report untouched).
