-- 203_owner_report_group_call.sql
--
-- BACKEND-ONLY report speed-up (no change to any report's output/format/numbers).
-- For a MULTI-restaurant owner, the reports route asked the DB ONCE PER RESTAURANT for the
-- money summary + payment settlement (N round-trips to the Mumbai DB, ~17-27s on the widest
-- report, occasionally timing out). Both RPCs already SUM across restaurants per bucket/method,
-- so a single grouped call over the owner's id-set returns the IDENTICAL merged rows in ONE
-- round-trip. This adds an optional p_ids uuid[] to each so the route can pass the owner's
-- restaurants and fetch them together.
--
--   p_restaurant_id set        -> that one restaurant (unchanged)
--   p_restaurant_id NULL, p_ids NULL -> ALL restaurants   (unchanged: admin all-view)
--   p_restaurant_id NULL, p_ids set  -> just those restaurants (NEW: scoped owner, one call)
--
-- Verified penny-identical to the previous per-restaurant fan-out + JS merge on the dev DB.
-- Signatures change (extra defaulted param), so DROP + recreate; existing 4-/3-arg callers
-- keep working via the default. GRANTs re-asserted.
