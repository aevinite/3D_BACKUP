--
-- WRITING DOWN A FUNCTION THAT WAS ONLY EVER APPLIED TO ONE DATABASE.
--
-- `lfh_place_order_public` on the dev/backup database carries a 2026-07-31 change — the
-- advisory lock that makes a guest order and a waiter order arriving on the same table share
-- ONE session — but NO migration in this folder defines it. The newest file that touches the
-- function is 206_rate_limit_guest_orders.sql, which predates the change.
--
-- That breaks the rule this folder exists for: one migrations folder is the single source of
-- truth for BOTH databases. The consequences were real and visible:
--   · AV live kept running the OLD 45-line body, so the client's guests never got the fix and
--     a guest order landing at the same moment as a waiter order could avoid sharing a session
--     (the family of the "table shows another party's food" bug);
--   · verify-db-parity could not go green, and a check that can never pass is a check people
--     learn to scroll past;
--   · a rebuild of the dev database would have silently LOST the change.
--
-- So this file is the function exactly as it runs on backup today, dumped from the live
-- database, so both stacks can be brought to it and kept there. Same remedy as
-- 236_write_down_the_unwritten_function.sql. CREATE OR REPLACE, so re-running is harmless.
--
-- Grants restated deliberately: this one IS guest-callable (the anon key places orders), which
-- is why anon keeps EXECUTE here — unlike the staff-only functions, which must be revoked from
-- anon (see 038).
