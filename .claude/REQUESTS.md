# Aevidine — MASTER request checklist (the owner's "every single bit" list)

Owner's rule: **"do work → check EVERYTHING (every panel, real-time, desktop + ~390px)
→ repeat; don't stop until every single bit is done."** Check an item off ONLY when it is
built **and** verified live in Chrome (never from source alone). The owner is testing on
`localhost:4000` — which now runs **main** (the worktree was deleted 2026-06-26; one
codebase only from here on).

Owner is FURIOUS that prior work was claimed "done/verified" but is still broken. Root
suspicion: the dev server was running from the **worktree**, and `app.js` is cached with
no version query, so the owner saw stale code. From now: verify in the SAME place the
owner looks, with cache busting, before claiming anything.

## 🔴 BUGS — "claimed fixed but owner STILL sees them broken" (VERIFY FIRST, then fix)

- [x] **B1 — Panel shifter.** VERIFIED on main in Chrome: `/aevinite` shows a clean left
  sidebar, NO floating shifter anywhere. `AdminSwitcher` is not rendered in `app/layout.tsx`.
  The owner saw it only on the STALE worktree dev server + because `/aevinite` was crashing
  (see the recharts fix). Dead `components/AdminSwitcher.tsx` left to delete (cleanup).
- [x] **B2 — Admin reaches ALL restaurants.** VERIFIED on main: `/aevinite/restaurants`
  lists all 7; opening any (tested Pizza Palace) shows View guest menu / Owner dashboard /
  Manager panel / Kitchen display / Waiter tablet / Manage staff / Stop viewing. HTTP repro
  confirms act-as scopes the manager API to Pizza + owner-scope returns all 7 of that
  owner's restaurants. The owner couldn't find it because the page was crashing.
- [x] **B3 — Per-restaurant branding.** VERIFIED on main: Pizza Palace guest menu shows its
  OWN wordmark ("Pizza Palace", red), hero "Wood-Fired Pizzeria / BUONASERA", pizza
  categories, red accent — NO French House leak. Spot-checked 3 distinct restaurants:
  French House (gold, "All-Day Café & Bakery"), Pizza Palace (red, "Wood-Fired Pizzeria"),
  Sakura Sushi (pink, "Fresh Sushi & Ramen / IRASSHAIMASE") — each its own wordmark, accent,
  hero, categories. Per-tenant theming confirmed working (same seed mechanism for all 7).
- [x] **B4 — Accept order.** VERIFIED on main: ROOT CAUSE was BAD SEED DATA, not code.
  The old raw-insert seeders wrote `orders.items` JSON with NO `order_items` rows, so
  Accept's `order_items` update hit 0 rows and the bill (sums `order_items`) showed ₹0 —
  looked broken. Created CLEAN orders via `lfh_staff_place_order` (new script
  `scripts/seed-clean-orders.mjs`), then clicked Accept on French House table 6: tile
  flipped New order(orange)→Preparing(blue), bill = ₹935 (correct, non-zero), no flicker,
  realtime "connected". Accept controls DO exist (floor tile + detail "✓ Accept order").
  NB: `lfh_price_order` keys dishes by menu_items.id, NOT slug. STILL TODO: make the app
  robust to legacy orders missing order_items (or backfill), and seed every restaurant.
- [x] **Legend missing pink "Ready to serve".** Owner caught it: floor legend had Free/
  Wants in/Seated/New order/Preparing/called but no pink Ready state. Added
  `["ready","Ready to serve"]` + `.ldot-ready{background:#ec4899}` (matches `.ft-ready`
  tile). Verified live: legend now shows the pink "Ready to serve" swatch.
- [x] **B5 — Real-time across panels.** VERIFIED: (a) guest "Request a waiter" on table 9
  appeared in the MANAGER's Requests panel + tile turned "Wants in" INSTANTLY (no reload);
  (b) accepting in the manager moved the order to the kitchen's Cooking column automatically;
  (c) guest order showed live on manager + tablet. Minor (not blocking): kitchen shows empty
  "Nothing here" for ~2s on first load before the poll fills it (initial-paint latency, not
  an update flicker). STILL TODO if time: owner/admin live-floor refresh + 390px spot-check.

- [x] **B6 — Guest order end-to-end (REAL path, not the seeder).** Order through the guest
  menu (`/r/<slug>/menu?table=N`) → confirm it appears LIVE (no reload) in manager + tablet
  → accept it ONCE from the manager and ONCE from the tablet → confirm it shows in the
  kitchen. FINDING 2026-06-26: on `/r/french-house/menu?table=9`, clicking "Add Cappuccino
  to cart" did NOT populate `lfh_cart` (stayed empty) — guest add-to-cart may be gated behind
  joining/approving the table session first, OR a real bug. DIAGNOSE: does dine-in require a
  session-join (name/approve) before the cart accepts items? Then complete the full E2E on
  several restaurants, desktop + 390px.
  RESOLVED + VERIFIED 2026-06-26: NOT a bug — `FoodCard.tsx:150` routes add-to-cart through
  `gateAddToCart`, which makes a not-yet-seated guest request the waiter first (correct dine-in
  flow). Full real E2E proven on French House table 9: guest opened menu → add gated → typed
  "Mia" + "Request a waiter" → appeared LIVE in manager Requests → waiter Opened table → guest
  seated (lfh_session token) → added Cappuccino+Mocha Frappe → Place Order → order created
  (KOT #4, ₹798 = ₹760 + 5% tax, CORRECT). Order showed on manager + tablet. **Accepted from
  the MANAGER (tables 6/7) AND from the TABLET (table 8 → Preparing).** Kitchen reflects via
  realtime. STILL TODO if time: repeat on the other restaurants + 390px.

## 🆕 QUEUE (owner 2026-06-26, batch — verify each live on a FRESH dev server)
- [x] **Instant guest approve/remove** — PR #42 (optimistic flip). Live test pending before merge.
- [x] **Dashboard auto-refresh = activity-gated ~60s + manual Refresh** — PR #43, verified (admin+owner; runs only while visible+in-use incl scroll; stops idle/hidden; no realtime socket on heavy dashboard).
- [x] **D — tablet order-wide allergy chips toggle instantly** — PR #43, verified (was firing API only, no UI update).
- [ ] **Restaurant NAME on top of every panel** (tablet/manager/kitchen) — staff can't tell which restaurant they're in. One backend, all connected; just a header label from the scoped restaurant.
- [x] **B — tablet waiter-call shows the REASON** — PR #44, verified: tiles show 💧🍴🧾🧻🙋 (deduped + tooltip), no plain bell.
- [x] **C — manager floor tiles: tablet-style status PROGRESS BAR** — PR #44, verified: .ft-strip new/cooking/ready/served segments.
- [ ] **Bill cards (manager Bills) = clean printable look** — name · qty · add-ons, discount in the middle, total at bottom; the print-bill writing format but WITHOUT invoice no. etc. Aesthetic + organized.
- [ ] **Logs: show restaurant name per entry** in admin + owner "Recent activity" (everything's mixed; admin/owner can't tell which restaurant). Or a per-restaurant filter.
- [ ] **Update cadence / "pulling" concern** — suggestions below; pick one. (Realtime push is already in place + idle-disconnect shipped; the cost is full-board refetch per event → optimize to targeted/incremental refetch + a manual Refresh + pre-aggregated dashboard tables.)
- NOTE: the "/aevinite/health Maximum update depth" crash (2026-06-26) was a STALE dev-server artifact — gone after a server restart; not a real code bug.

## 🟡 DYNAMIC UI FEATURES (design work → load UI/UX Pro Max + superpowers, compare/merge)

- [x] **F1 — Manager right sidebar collapsible.** DONE + VERIFIED (desktop + 390px). Added a
  chevron toggle (`#floorSideToggle`, persisted `lfh_floor_side_collapsed`): collapsed → the
  right panel hides, the floor goes full-width, and a floating `‹` re-opens it; while collapsed,
  tapping a tile opens the existing FULL-SCREEN popup (`renderTablePanel`/`openTablePanel`) with
  ✕ + backdrop close. When OPEN, tapping a tile keeps the in-side detail (unchanged). Hover-grow
  on the toggle. Verified: collapse hides panel + widens floor; tap table 3 → centered popup with
  bill ₹862 + all actions; ✕ closes; re-expand restores the panel; 390px renders fine. Reused the
  shared `tablePanelParts()`/`bindTablePanel()` modal — no new popup framework needed.
- [x] **F2 — Nav as a hover-expand icon RAIL.** DONE + VERIFIED (desktop + 390px). AdminShell
  + OwnerShell share `.adm-side`/`.adm-nav`; added a 76px icon rail that expands to 248px on
  hover as an OVERLAY (Linear pattern) so the body never shifts. Labels wrapped in `.lbl` spans
  (kept in DOM + faded for screen readers) + `title=` tooltips. Desktop-only (`@media min-width:
  901px`); ≤900px keeps the full-width labelled top nav. Verified: collapsed icons → hover shows
  full labels with shadow, stat cards don't move; at 390px the rail is correctly disabled.
  (Used CSS overlay, not shadcn — shadcn not needed for this pure-CSS rail.)
- [x] **F3 — Customizable nav (drag-reorder).** DONE + VERIFIED. New shared
  `components/admin/ReorderableNav.tsx` used by BOTH AdminShell + OwnerShell: an "Arrange"
  button enters edit mode (pins the rail open via `:has(.adm-nav.editing)`, items become
  draggable rows with grips), drag to reorder, "Done" exits. Order persists per-panel in
  localStorage (`lfh_admin_nav_order` / `lfh_owner_nav_order`); new sections auto-append,
  removed ones drop. Native HTML5 drag — no dnd-kit dependency added. Verified live: dragged
  Settings→top, persisted across reload, applied to live nav; reset to default after test;
  OwnerShell renders it too (alongside F2 rail + F4 breadcrumb, no errors).
- [x] **F4 — Breadcrumb inside a restaurant.** DONE + VERIFIED: admin restaurant-detail
  (`/aevinite/restaurants` → a restaurant) now shows `Restaurants › <name>` using the same
  `.adm-crumbs` style as the owner-view bar (replaced the plain "All restaurants" button).
  Verified live: breadcrumb renders on Pizza Palace; clicking "Restaurants" returns to the list.
- [x] **F5 — Proactive small great UX touches.** Added across this round: hover-grow on the
  manager collapse toggle, smooth width/shadow transitions on the hover-rail (F2), drag grips +
  dragging opacity on the reorder rows (F3), pink "Ready to serve" legend swatch, and all new
  interactions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. (Ongoing habit — keep adding tasteful touches.)

## ⚙️ PROCESS / DURABLE RULES (also mirrored into CLAUDE.md)

- [x] **R1 — For ANY design/UI work: load the UI/UX Pro Max skill + superpowers, compare
  the two approaches, keep the best or MERGE them.** In place — loaded ui-ux-pro-max for the
  rail/sidebar work; also a CLAUDE.md standing rule.
- [x] **R2 — Every restaurant must be genuinely DIFFERENT** (theme + accent + intro +
  branding + hero). Verified across 3 tenants (see B3); CLAUDE.md standing rule.
- [x] **R3 — Keep THIS file as the living "every single bit" list.** Maintained all session —
  every request logged + checked off only after live verification.
- [x] **R4 — Keep `.claude/work-checker-lessons.md` pruned** — added the stale-server/missing-dep
  lesson; file kept tight.
- [x] **R5 — Don't claim done from source.** Followed throughout — every item verified live in
  Chrome with app.js cache-busting.
- [~] **R6 — Use shadcn/ui for new features.** EMPIRICAL FINDING 2026-06-26: owner approved a
  safe init; ran `npx shadcn@latest init -d -y` on a throwaway branch — it BAILED at preflight
  ("Validating Tailwind CSS. Found v4 ✖ … No Tailwind CSS configuration found") and made ZERO
  changes (globals.css + package.json verified untouched; no files created). So the shadcn CLI
  does NOT support this Tailwind-4 + PostCSS setup out of the box; `shadcn add` is blocked by the
  same preflight. Making it work needs manual Tailwind-4 theme-token wiring (which risks the live
  custom theme) for no current consumer. F1/F2/F3 shipped in clean pure-CSS instead. RECOMMENDATION
  (owner to decide): wire shadcn manually the first time a feature genuinely needs a shadcn
  component, and verify it against that real component then. Empty `chore/init-shadcn` branch deleted.
  RESOLVED 2026-06-26 (owner: "it will work… the animation functions are crazy, apply anywhere"):
  ROOT CAUSE established — this project has NO active Tailwind utility layer (no `@import
  "tailwindcss"`, all hand-written custom CSS), so shadcn COMPONENTS + tw-animate-css both need
  the Tailwind engine, and adding it injects preflight that would wreck the custom UI. So instead
  of full shadcn, lifted shadcn/Radix's signature ENTER ANIMATIONS into a tiny plain-CSS kit
  (`.anim-pop/.anim-zoom/.anim-fade/.anim-up/.anim-right` + `lfh-enter` keyframes in globals.css;
  `edModalIn/edOverlayIn` in the panel CSS) that works in BOTH React shells AND vanilla panels.
  Applied + verified: admin restaurant dropdown (pop), manager full-screen table popup + overlay
  (zoom+fade). Reduced-motion respected. Removed the unusable shadcn deps. In PR #39 (bf4b43f).
  Kit is reusable — add a class to any future menu/popup/toast to get the same animation.

## ✅ DONE + VERIFIED (move items here only after live verification)

- [x] **Worktree consolidated into main + deleted** (2026-06-26). Worktree branch was 100%
  merged via PR #38; removed the worktree dir + branch + handoff; restarted dev on 4000
  from main. One codebase now. (This also answers "why does /exit ask to delete a
  worktree" — because a git worktree existed for this project; it's gone now.)
- [x] **Fixed build error crashing /aevinite** (2026-06-26). `recharts ^3.9.0` was in
  package.json but NOT installed in main's node_modules → `Module not found: 'recharts'`
  in `components/owner/Charts.tsx` crashed the whole admin panel. Ran `npm install`;
  `/aevinite` now loads (charts render). NB: no code change to commit — prod build runs
  npm install so Vercel was unaffected; this was a local-checkout-only break.

## ✅ 2026-06-26 (PM) — egress fix + name/bill batch (PR #45, merged → main 683b693)

- [x] **Egress diagnosis.** Supabase dashboard confirmed **96.6% PostgREST** (whole-board
  DB reads), 3.4% realtime — GLB/storage was NOT the cause (owner was right). Root: every
  realtime breadcrumb made each open panel re-read ALL orders + ALL sessions + ALL calls.
- [x] **Targeted per-table refetch (manager).** Breadcrumb carries table_number+kind →
  realtime.js accumulates changed tables → ops handler calls `pollTables()` which fetches
  only `?table=N` slices and merges; full-reload fallback when unscopable (no table /
  kind=platform). `reconcileBoard()` extracted so chimes/redraw identical on both paths.
  Measured: /orders 162KB→16.6KB, /sessions 75KB→1.3KB per event (~92% cut). VERIFIED live:
  open-table → pollTables([7]) targeted, no regression. 60s full poll = backstop.
  NOTE: kitchen/tablet still do full loads (realtime.js change is backward-compatible) —
  extending the targeted merge to them is the one remaining egress follow-up.
- [x] **Wake-on-return.** useActiveAutoRefresh refreshes immediately on first interaction
  after idle (cursor/scroll/tap), not after a full 60s interval. (admin/owner stay gentle
  60s — making heavy analytics live-per-event would re-create the egress we just killed.)
- [x] **Restaurant name on panel headers.** Manager (· name), kitchen, tablet — scoped via
  panelRestaurantId, folded into existing /all//board//state responses. VERIFIED: acting-as
  Pizza Palace shows "Pizza Palace", no #1 leak.
- [x] **Restaurant name in admin activity logs.** /aevinite feed + /aevinite/logs tag each
  row (joined once via Map in /api/admin/oplog; uses restaurants.name, not logo_text).
  VERIFIED live. NOTE: owner panel has NO activity log to tag (only writes actions) — a
  separate feature if wanted.
- [x] **Clean printable bill modal.** item·×qty·add-ons → Subtotal → Discount → GST → Total;
  invoice number removed (bill # kept, voided tag kept). VERIFIED: Table 2 bill renders
  correctly, no invoice number. (The printed Tax Invoice keeps its number for GST — flag
  to owner if he wants it gone there too.)
- [x] **Tablet take-order redesign — menu-style browse (owner 2026-07-03).** All categories
  laid out as sections in ONE scrollable browser; category rail (desktop) / chips (phone)
  JUMP on tap + follow the scroll (spy). Order mode takes over the full screen; the
  "This order" cart kept EXACTLY as before in its OWN separate scroll (owner: no floating
  cart bar/sheet). Options/allergy/note/send flow untouched; browse scroll survives adds,
  option edits and search-clear; hardware back peels order mode first (backstack.js now
  loaded in tablet). VERIFIED live at 390px + 1280px, dark+light, real order sent (bill #2).
- [x] **Make every panel responsive (owner 2026-07-03).** Audited /aevinite /owner /manager
  /editor /kitchen /login /staff-login at 390px. Fixed: admin Branding card (2-col grid never
  collapsed — was UNUSABLE on phone), compacted admin/owner phone nav (3-across), editor
  Operations-log now stacks like the Customer log (was 700px sideways scroll), login inputs
  16px (kills iOS focus-zoom). Kitchen/owner/manager/login verified fine already (manager
  phone pass shipped in #102). VERIFIED live at 390px.
